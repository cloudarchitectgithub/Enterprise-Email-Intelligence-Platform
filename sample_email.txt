Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to schedule a meeting to discuss the upcoming project requirements and timeline.

We need to cover:
1. Project scope and deliverables
2. Resource allocation
3. Timeline and milestones
4. Risk assessment

Would you be available for a 1-hour meeting sometime this week? I'm flexible with timing, but prefer mornings if possible.

Please let me know your availability and I'll send out calendar invites to the team.

Best regards,
John Doe
Project Manager
